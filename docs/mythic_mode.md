2. Keep macOS updated
3. Keep Mythic client updated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   - Run with sudo
   - Check file permissions

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Verify no heavy background processes
   - Monitor CPU/RAM usage
   - Check internet connection

3. **Application Conflicts**
   - Close competing applications
   - Check for system updates
   - Verify Mythic installation

## Technical Details

The script performs these operations:

1. **Process Management**
   - Process priority adjustment
   - Service optimization

2. **System Optimization**
   - Cache clearing
   - Memory management
   - DNS optimization
   - Hibernation control

3. **Performance Configuration**
   - Process scheduling
   - System responsiveness
   - Resource allocation

## Additional Notes

- All changes are temporary
- System returns to normal after restart
- Compatible with all Mythic game modes
- Optimized for both casual and competitive play

In a next future I'll generate launch arguments for Mythic, for now it's an almost copy of roblox_mode.sh but it works at least.
