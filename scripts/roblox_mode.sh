# Clear system caches
# -------------------------------

# Clear system memory cache to free up RAM (may improve performance)
sudo purge                                                                  # This clears system memory cache (RAM) - Safe to use, but can slow things down temporarily.

# Clear system shared dynamic libraries cache (rebuilds on next boot)
sudo update_dyld_shared_cache                                               # Clears the dynamic library cache - Safe to use



# -------------------------------
# Adjust memory and system settings
# -------------------------------

# Enable fast memory compression for more efficient memory use (improves performance under memory pressure)
sudo sysctl vm.compressor_mode=4                                            # Safe, adjusts the memory compression mode to a faster one

# Aggressively purge memory when under heavy memory pressure
sudo sysctl kern.memorystatus_purge_on_urgent=1                             # Safe, this forces memory purging when under memory pressure

# Clear DNS cache to avoid any potential network resolution issues
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache                                                # Safe, clears DNS cache

# Restart the DNS service to refresh DNS settings
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder                                             # Safe, restarts mDNSResponder for network name resolution



# -------------------------------
# Launch Roblox
# -------------------------------

# Open Roblox (will launch the Roblox app)
open -a Roblox  # Safe, launches the Roblox application



# -------------------------------
# Disable hibernation (optional for performance)
# -------------------------------

# Disables hibernation to prevent the system from writing memory to disk (saves time during startup)
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0                                               # Safe, but disables sleep to disk, so youâ€™ll lose the ability to resume from hibernation.



# -------------------------------
# Set Roblox process priority (if running)
# -------------------------------

# Increase the priority of the Roblox process to allocate more CPU resources to it
